          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
		  I wanted to become a computer scientist since I was in grade 6th.
		  I have taken my journey towards my aspirations seriously. I opted for 
		  courses that would help me polish my skills before I enter Illinois Tech to 
		  pursue my career goals. I want to become a research scientist in the
		  field of computer science particularly focusing on algorithms that can
		  help shape the latest developments in technology. I have expertise in
		  basic programming languages such as python, java and C#. I have built
		  applications on my own to polish my skills and to better prepare myself
		  for the courses that will be offered at <i>Illinois Institute of Technology.</i>
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  I plan on completing my college and pursuing a research degree to develop
		  patents and solve real world problems at hand. Technology now-a-days can
		  resolve many problems but it first needs to be nourished before it can be
		  applied in safety critical situations. My goal is to complete degree work
		  by research and implementation throughout the duration of my degree and to
		  start collaborating with research labs and helping them in developing
		  better and more efficient solutions.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  I am plan to attend <i>Illinois Institute of Technology</i> because it is
		  offer me the field of study I want to build my career in, with some
		  personal ease and advantages. Illinois Tech is situated very near to my
		  house and it would be convenient for me to pursue my studies there. By
		  opting for Illinois Tech I can easily understand the subject I have always
		  liked and cared for with the addition to ease I can bring to my parents.
		  By opting Illinois Tech it will be easy for me to come home and focus on
		  my research rather than wasting time and money in living arrangements in
		  some other town. I will be able to properly understand the subjects and
		  still find time to perform research at Institute level.

		  I have been a chess player since 8 Grade; it has always been an interest
		  to me. My father used to teach me mathematics based on checkers of check
		  board teaching me how we can interpret reactions from one row down to one
		  column up. Besides chess I play football and badminton. It has always
		  helped me in making good friends through sports. It leaves a feeling of
		  trust once in you are a part of a team. It helps you feel better and more
		  motivated. And it teaches you how to value and respect other people
		  preferences. I have attended some seminars on cloud computing for my own
		  knowledge and I am an active participant in social services activities.
		  I believe money can help but connecting with people at a deeper level
		  is more important, I like to go to orphanages to talk to children there
		  and play with them. I am not a regular but I take my rounds every 3 months.
		  It helps me feel more important and contributing to the society. I also
		  organized a Keep Clean Keep Green campaign around 2 years ago. We spent
		  hours in streets educating people and gathering friends to help and clean
		  the environment.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  I believe every person in this world has a mission; it depends upon the
		  person how he/she sails the perturbed boat. The main purpose is to
		  understand and be reliable about situations at hand and give your best so
		  that whenever it comes back to you, it is the same level of best that you
		  sowed a few years ago.
